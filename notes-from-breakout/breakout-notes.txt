Goodwill Breakout Notes
-----------------------


Social Media?

-Sure. 

-Extent of social media integration? 

Make connections between different departments and locations.
(Should we, for the moment, limit this to sharing scores, activities via Facebook, Twitter, etc.?)

-Demographics?

Large number of women. Lots of people in late 20's to late 40's. Keep in mind people with disabilities, both physical and intellectual. 
(Use high contrast text, keep everything minimal and simple!) This is targeted to Goodwill employees.

-Interconnectivity?

Maybe make more general to share with various nonprofits. (Include a leaderboard!)

(In addition to daily challenge, maintain list of challenges to play peer-to-peer with some other user)


-Backend ideas?

Need database of users, database of challenges.

-Admin aspect

Ideally develop webapp to interface with database(s) so admins can add/edit and push challenges and perform analysis.
(Perhaps leave this for sales pitch and focus on the actual app)
